Atlas Creator
-------------

The Atlas Creator allows users to pack a bunch of single images into an image atlas.
This reduces the number of files you need to pack with your game and speeds up rendering! 

The tool is written in C++ using Qt.

It was initially developed by kozmo, one of our talented GSoC students.

### Requirements

- Qt build toolchain and development packages
