Image Atlas Creator

The Image Atlas Creator allows users to combine multiple images into an image atlas.
This reduces the number of files you need to ship with your game and speeds up rendering! 

The tool is written in C++ using Qt.

It was initially developed by kozmo, one of our talented GSoC students.
